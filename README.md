# Live Glasgow parking data

Practice app that makes use of JSON feed from http://data.glasgow.gov.uk/dataset/glasgow-car-parks-feed to display live parking data of Glasgow City Council car parks on a streetmap.

Built with AngularJS. Runs a Nodejs server to pull that feed and passes it along to the controller via a service.
